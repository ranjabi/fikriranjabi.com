# How to Display OCR in React

In this tutorial, I will show you step by step to display Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in React. This article will only cover the rendering aspect of OCR. I will use Google Vertex AI for the text extraction process.

Before we start, I want to introduce you into a thing called Bounding Box. Bounding box is a rectangle that surrounds an object on certain position. For the example, you can see bounding box that mark the extracted text on invoice below. This will be the main part of rendering process.
